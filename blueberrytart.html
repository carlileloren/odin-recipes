                <ul>
                    <li>3 1/2 cups blueberries</li>

                    <li>1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 to 1 1/2 tablespoons tapioca flour/starch (see Note, below)</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>To Finish</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water (optional)</li>
                    <li>Turbinado or coarse sugar for sprinkling</li>
                    <li>Softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, to serve</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Make the pastry.</em> Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Sprinkle butter over dough and using a pastry blender or your fingertips, work it into the flour until the mixture resembles small peas. Sprinkle sour cream and 3 tablespoons water over mixture and stir/mash it together to combine; it should form large clumps; add last tablespoon water if it does not. Use your hands to bring it together into a single mass. Transfer dough to a large square of parchment paper, patting it into a flatter packet, and wrap it tightly. Chilling it in the fridge until firm, 1 to 2 hours or up to 4 days. You can hasten the firming process along in the freezer, for about 20 minutes.</li><br>
                <li><em>Make the filling.</em> Combine fruit, salt, citrus juice (if using), sugar, and starch in a medium bowl and set aside.</li><br>
                <li><em>Assemble the tart.</em> Heat oven to 400Â°F and flatten the parchment paper that you wrapped your dough in on a large baking sheet. On a floured counter, roll the dough out into a large round-ish shape, about 14 inches across. Gently transfer it to the parchment paper in the pan. Spoon fruit filling and any juices that have collected into center, leaving a 2- to 3-inch border uncovered. Fold this border over fruit, pleating the edge to make it fit. The center will be open.<br>For a darker, glossier crust, beat egg with 1 teaspoon of water and brush it over the crust. Sprinkle it all over with turbinado or coarse sugar.</li><br>
                <li><em>Bake.</em> For 30 to 35 minutes, or golden all over and the fruit is bubbling and juicy. Cool for at least 20 minutes on wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
            </ol>    
                <p><em>Notes:</em> Fruit galettes keep at room temperature for a few days and up to a week in the fridge.</p><br>
