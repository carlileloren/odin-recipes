                <h5>Decoration</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1-2 kinds of red candy hearts or sprinkles</li>
                    </ul>
            <h4>Process</h4>
                <h5>Pink Reduction</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><em>Soften/puree strawberries.</em> With a fork or a blender, mash the defrosted strawberries. A fork offers a chunkier texture, while the blender makes your mixture smoother.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Heat strawberries and sugar.</em> Place strawberries and sugar into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over med heat.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Reduce heat.</em> Once bubbling, reduce heat to low and let slowly reduce until berries begin to break up and liquid is almost gone. </li><br>
                        <li><em>Stir, add citrus and salt.</em> Occasionally stir the mixture to prevent burning. Add in lemon zest, juice and salt and stir to combine. Transfer to another container and let cool before use. </li>
                        <p><em>Notes:</em> Store extra in the freezer for up to 6 months.</p><br>
                    </ol>    
                <h5>Pink Cake</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <p><em>Notes:</em> It is SUPER IMPORTANT that all the room temperature ingredients listed above are room temperature and not cold or hot. Make sure to take your strawberry reduction out of the refrigerator 1 hour before making your cake so that it comes to room temperature. </p>
                        <li><em>Preheat oven.</em> Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 350ºF/176ºC.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Prep your pans.</em> Grease three 8" cake pans with cake goop or preferred pan release.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Combine wet ingredients.</em> In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the milk, strawberry reduction, strawberry emulsion, vanilla extract, lemon extract, lemon zest, lemon juice, and pink food coloring.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Combine dry ingredients.</em> In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Cream the butter.</em> Add room temperature butter to your stand mixer with the paddle attachment and beat at medium speed until smooth and shiny, about 30 seconds.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Add sugar to the butter.</em> Gradually sprinkle in the sugar, beat until mixture is fluffy and almost white, about 3-5 minutes.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Add egg whites.</em> Add the egg whites one at a time, beating 15 seconds in between. Your mixture should look cohesive at this point. If it looks curdled and broken, your butter or egg whites were too cold. </li><br>
                        <li><em>Gradually add dry ingredients.</em> Mix on low speed and add about a third of the dry ingredients to the batter, followed immediately by about a third of the milk mixture, mix until ingredients are almost incorporated into the batter. Repeat the process 2 more times. When the batter appears blended, stop the mixer and scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. If it looks like ice cream, you did it right!</li><br>
                        <li><em>Divide batter.</em> Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Smooth the tops with a rubber spatula.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Bake.</em> Bake cakes at 350ºF/176ºC until they feel firm in the center and a toothpick comes out clean or with just a few crumbs on it, about 30-35 minutes.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Let cool.</em> Place pans on top of a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Then flip your cakes onto the racks and cool completely. </li><br>
                        <li><em>Prep for assembly.</em> Once cooled, wrap each layer in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze before assembling your cake. </li>
                    </ol>
                <h5>Pink Buttercream</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><em>Combine sugar and egg whites.</em> Place egg whites and powdered sugar in a stand mixer bowl. Attach the whisk and combine ingredients on low and then whip on high for 5 minutes. </li><br>
                        <li><em>Add butter.</em> Add in your softened butter in chunks and whip on high for 8-10 minutes until it's very white, light and shiny. It may look curdled and yellow at first, this is normal. Keep whipping.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Add final ingredients.</em> Add in strawberry reduction, vanilla extract and salt and continue whipping until incorporated.</li>
                        <p><em>Optional:</em> Switch to a paddle attachment and mix on low for 15-20 minutes to make the buttercream very smooth and remove air bubbles.</p>
                    </ol>
                <h5>Decoration</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><em>Cool your cakes entirely.</em> Your cakes must be completely cooled prior to decoration, otherwise the buttercream will melt off.</li><br>
                        <li><em>Stack your cakes.</em> Place your first layer of strawberry cake onto a cake plate or cake board. Trim off the dome if needed with a sharp knife so the top of the cake is flat. </li><br>
                        <li><em>Add some reduction.</em> Add a very thin layer or your cooled reduction over the cut surface. This helps soak into the cake and adds moisture and strawberry flavor. </li><br>
                        <li><em>Add buttercream to the middle.</em> Add a layer of strawberry buttercream, I shoot for about ¼". Smooth it with your offset spatula until it's flat. </li><br>
                        <li><em>Frost and decorate!</em> Frost the outside of your cake with the leftover buttercream and decorate with some the red candy hearts/sprinkles.</li>
