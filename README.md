# odin-recipes

This is my first project for The Odin Project. My objective is to build the HTML for a recipe site. I should be able to create the boilerplate, the head, and the body of multiple web pages, using links to navigate from page to page. 

This will be a Stardew Valley inspired recipe site that blends my own personal artwork with the visual styles of the original game.
